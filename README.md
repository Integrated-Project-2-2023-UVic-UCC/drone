# Follow-me robot

Follower robots are devices that use sensors to detect and track a person or object. These robots can be programmed to move in a specific direction and maintain a certain distance from what they are following. Such robots are used in various applications, such as surveillance, logistics, inspection, and support for people with mobility impairments. Thanks to their ability to follow and interact with their users, follower robots are gaining popularity in many fields.

Creating a robot that follows a person and carries boxes can be an exciting and useful project. The robot should be designed with sensors and algorithms that allow it to detect and track the person in real-time, while also being able to carry heavy objects such as boxes. This may require the integration of motors and acceleration mechanisms so that the robot can move efficiently, as well as advanced software that can interpret sensor data to control the robot's movement. With proper planning and the right tools, creating a robot that follows a person and carries boxes could be a highly rewarding task with great potential for practical applications.
